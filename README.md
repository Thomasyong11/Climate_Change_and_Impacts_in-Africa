# Climate Change and Impacts in Africa

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project on "Climate Change and Impacts in Africa." In this project, we will be analyzing and reporting the state of climate change in Africa using the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset. Our goal is to provide insights into the trends and impacts of climate change across different African regions.

## About Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors such as changes in solar activity and volcanic eruptions can contribute to these shifts, human activities have become the primary driver of climate change since the 1800s. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, has significantly contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a range of consequences, including droughts, water scarcity, rising sea levels, and more.

## The Dataset

We will be using the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset, which is part of the EDGAR Community GHG database version 7.0 (2022). This dataset contains information on CO2 emissions from various countries and industries between 1970 and 2021. The dataset consists of three sheets: "IPCC 2006," "1PCC 1996," and "TOTALS BY COUNTRY." The relevant columns in these sheets include the region of the world, country code, country name, CO2 emissions over the years, and industry responsible for emissions.

You can access the dataset directly [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cNhVUPKYP79AayGJp89_tXCJmHoxQO4cwiaseSziwbY/edit#gid=191680117).

## Project Tasks

The head of analytics has outlined several tasks for this project:

1. **Data Cleaning and Tidying**: We will start by cleaning and tidying the dataset to ensure its accuracy and consistency.

2. **Trend Analysis**: We will create line plots to visualize the trends in CO2 levels across different African regions.

3. **Time vs. CO2 Analysis**: We will analyze the relationship between time (year) and CO2 levels in African regions.

4. **Regional Comparison**: We will determine if there is a significant difference in CO2 levels among African regions.

5. **Top Industries**: We will identify the most common industries responsible for CO2 emissions in each African region.

6. **High CO2 Industries**: We will determine the industry responsible for the highest average CO2 emissions in each African region.

7. **CO2 Prediction**: We will predict CO2 levels in the year 2025 for each African region.

8. **CO2 and Temperature Relationship**: We will investigate whether CO2 levels have an impact on annual temperatures in selected African countries.

## Get Involved

We invite fellow researchers, data scientists, and climate enthusiasts to contribute to this project. You can clone this repository, explore the dataset, and participate in the analysis and reporting process. By collaborating, we can gain valuable insights into the state of climate change in Africa and its impacts on the continent.

Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Let's work together to create a comprehensive report that sheds light on the critical issue of climate change in Africa.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the United Nations for their efforts in addressing climate change and providing valuable information for this project. Additionally, the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset has been instrumental in our analysis and reporting.
